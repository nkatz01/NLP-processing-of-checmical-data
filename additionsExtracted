potassium osmate dihydrate (97.3 mg, 0.38 mmol) were added to a solution of (5R,7aS)‐5‐butyl‐1H,3H,5H,7aH‐pyrrolo[1,2‐c][1,3]oxazol‐3‐one (347 mg, 1.91 mmol) in acetone/H2O (2:1, 54 mL).

To a solution of H2PtCl6 (0.01 mmol, 4.28 mg) in 2 mL dry toluene in a 100 mL Fisher Porter tube was added 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol and 0.5 mmol of KH 

and filled with nitrogen (three cycles). (1S,2S)-1,2-Bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (1.0 g, 4.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 97%) is added through the open neck

then anhydrous DMSO (20 mL, 99.8+%) and 2-methylbenzaldehyde (1.23 g, 10.2 mmol, 2.5 equiv, 97%) are added into the flask 

After the yellow solution is stirred for 14 h at 20 °C, the reaction is quenched by the addition of distilled water (100 mL),

Dichloromethane (0.4 M) is added to a round-bottomed flask. The benzylamine (1 equiv) and benzophenone imine (1 equiv) are then added 

To a pyridine (60 ml) solution of Gd(OTf)3·9H2O (500 mg; 0.65 mmol) YbL·4H2O (200 mg; 0.22 mmol) is added.

To the cooled (0 ℃) solution of methyl 3,3-dimethylpent-4-enoate (2, 142 g, 1.0 mol) in dry THF (500 ml) was slowly added lithium aluminum hydride (38 g, 1 mol).

and then 4 M hydrochloric acid (1000 ml) was added dropwise

A stirred solution of rac-17a1 (330 mg, 0.64 mmol) in THF (12 mL) was added TBAF (1.0 M in THF, 0.7 mL, 0.70 mmol) 

The yellow complex, chloro(ƞ4–cycloocta–1,5–diene)(1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene) iridium(I) (0.700 g, 1.093 mmol),30 was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL) in a previously flame-dried roundbottom flask, fitted with a stopcock sidearm. After all the solids had dissolved, silver hexafluorophosphate (0.276 g, 1.093 mmol) was added,

Addition of triphenylphosphine (0.287 g, 1.093 mmol) to the resulting clear orange solution

 Addition of ethyl acetate (~5 mL) resulted
 
 1,3-bis(2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl)-4,5-dimethylimidazolium chloride (0.340 g, 0.750 mmol) was added to a flame-dried Schlenk flask under an argon atmosphere. Dry THF (7.5 mL) was added with stirring,
 
  Stirring was continued at r.t. for 30 min before the addition of [Ir(COD)Cl]2.
  
  To a flame dried two necked round bottom flask, equipped with a stopcock, was added 4b (189 mg, 0.500 mmol, 1 eq.) and the iridium(I) catalyst (0.00325 mmol, 6.5 mol%). To this was added DCM (14.0 mL)
  
  A suspension of NaH (2.12 g, 52.9 mmol, 1.20 equiv, 60% in mineral oil) in THF/DMSO (10:1, 150 mL) was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of ethylene glycol (7.40 mL, 132 mmol, 3.00 equiv).
  
  After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of tributyl(iodomethyl)stannane (19.0 g, 44.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv)
